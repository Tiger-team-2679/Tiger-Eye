# Tiger-Eye
a cool framework and api to be used in competiton and module development. This was created to replace the old project 'FRC-Framework'.

This project was inspired by [this awesome project](https://github.com/Open-RIO/ToastAPI), so big thank to Jaci.

Keep in mind that this readme is temporary, and will be modified when this project is deemed stable and ready. Currently, this project is not ready for public release.
